SELECT * FROM Members;

-- View all issued books with member and book names
SELECT 
    IssueID,
    Members.Name AS MemberName,
    Books.Title AS BookTitle,
    IssueDate,
    ReturnDate
FROM IssuedBooks
JOIN Members ON IssuedBooks.MemberID = Members.MemberID
JOIN Books ON IssuedBooks.BookID = Books.BookID;

-- View books not yet returned
SELECT 
    IssueID,
    Members.Name,
    Books.Title,
    IssueDate
FROM IssuedBooks
JOIN Members ON IssuedBooks.MemberID = Members.MemberID
JOIN Books ON IssuedBooks.BookID = Books.BookID
WHERE ReturnDate IS NULL;

-- Count how many times each book was issued
SELECT 
    Books.Title,
    COUNT(IssuedBooks.IssueID) AS TimesIssued
FROM IssuedBooks
JOIN Books ON IssuedBooks.BookID = Books.BookID
GROUP BY Books.Title;
```
